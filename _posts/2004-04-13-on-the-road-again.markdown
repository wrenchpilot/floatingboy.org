well, it's official. i'm off to Atlanta, GA. just got hired at Georgia Tech and will be glad to leave the "city that never wakes", which didn't work well with me since i'm the "guy that never sleeps" (except during the day). huge thanks go out to mike and all my references, but mike was my inside guy. we got it.

mood: fairly excited | music: fugazi - guilford fall demo
