A winning Pepsi cap isn't just a song, it's a chance to send Pepsi's 99
cents somewhere good. When a cap is redeemed, Pepsi pays Apple 99 cents
for the song, and Apple passes along 65 cents to a record label.
Unfortunately, most of the music on iTunes is put out by one of the 5
major record labels, and their business practices are highly suspect.
When you buy an iTunes song from a major label, there's a good chance
the artist won't see a penny, because they're still recouping. If the
artist does get a cut, it's only about 10 cents from the 99 cents you
paid. But we can do better!
