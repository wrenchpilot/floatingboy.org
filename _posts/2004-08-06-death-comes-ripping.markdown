let's write this in plain text. no need for fancy formatting. no one really needs spell check if we all know what was meant. let's write it all on one line. no need for line breaks. it's all a stream of bullshit anyway. horseshit. pigshit. shit. i like to think that i hate to be alone. but that's all i really want...to be left alone. the worst thing...i know how lazy and unimaginative that i really am...let's do something wasteful, let's waste time...which could be argued that that's all one does. what really constitutes using time valuably? is that a good question?

mood: misfit | music: you make the call.
