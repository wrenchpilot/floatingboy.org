just found out that a [guy i know](http://tbssuperstation.com/stories/story/0,,34965,00.html) from back in the day is on the new TBS show "[He's a Lady](http://tbssuperstation.com/shows/hesalady)". Way to go Mike.

I went out with your sister on a date once, does that make me famous by
association? Any who, would be cool if he wins, says he'll buy a
house for him and his "lady".
