i'll tell ya, gin has an adverse effect on me being sober and Paula Poundstone is a master of stand up comedy. I'm always inspired by anyone who can stand in front of a crowd of people who you know are bible thumping "christians" and say, "I'm an athiest", and still make them all laugh.

What's so funny about that, is that these people probably know deep down that there is no god and jesus was, in fact, a confidence man. The most famous and sucessful of all the con men. And why? People are dumb. People are scared. People want to have meaning and purpose. Sad fact, there is no meaning, you have no purpose.

"Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream and we're the imagination of ourselves... Here's Tom with the weather". --Bill Hicks
