today it snowed, and all the churches postponed their services. then
the boss called and told me that i didn't have to work monday. the only
thing that ruins it, is celebrities kissing their own and each other's
ass on tv.

i would like to thank myself for being cool and
talented, and yuengling black & tan for inspiration, and god for
letting me fulfill his dreams of fame and fortune.
