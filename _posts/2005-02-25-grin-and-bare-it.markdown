mood: hung up | music: the hang ups  
last night i had to sit and listen to angel tell me about the guy jacee has been going out with.

1. i really wish angel and jacee weren't friends.

2. i really don't want to hear about jacee being with other people.

3. that is all.

On a totally different topic, I had a dream that Brad and Michelle got
remarried (even though they aren't actually divorced yet) and they
didn't call me.
