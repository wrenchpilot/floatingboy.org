I think this falls into the "what-the-fuck-where-you-thinking dept". Of the two images below, the left represents Minor Threat's 1981 album, on the right an "advertising" campaign launched by Nike Skateboarding for their East Coast Tour. The fact that this is a rip-off of Minor Threat's album cover really doesn't bother me; the fact that the people responsible for this rip-off obviously don't know anything about what Minor Threat as a band was or what Dischord Records stands for. The use of something produced by Dischord Records for the purpose of whoring products for a major corporation such as Nike (the greed [edit: Freudian slip, I meant greek, but it still works] goddess of whoring, if I remember correctly), is quite the kick in the balls. In my humble and not even regarded opinion, Dischord should sue the shit out of Nike, then donate proceeds from the settlement to Washington, DC based charities...major threat my ass.

Many people have now noticed that Nike has appropriated the Minor Threat artwork and logo for a new skateboard demo / ad campaign. To set the record straight -- Nike never contacted Dischord to obtain permission to use this imagery, nor was any permission granted. Simply put, Nike stole it and we're not happy about it. We are not yet sure what options, if any, we have to stop Nike from using our images to sell their shoes, but if you would like to direct your complaints to Nike that would be a good place to start.

You can [email](http://swoosh.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/swoosh.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php) Nike.

Or give them a call:

    Nike World Headquarters: 1-800-344-6453 Mon- Fri 6:30 am - 4:50 pm (Pacific Time)

To longtime fans and supporters of Minor Threat and Dischord this must seem like just another familiar example of mainstream corporations attempting to to assimilate underground culture to turn a buck. However it is more disheartening to us to think that Nike may be successful in using this imagery to fool kids, just beginning to becoming familiar with skate culture, underground music and DIY ideals, into thinking that the general ethos of this label, and Minor Threat in particular, can somehow be linked to Nike's mission. In any regard, we would like to thank the many people who have written to us in the last several days to express their outrage, support and encouragement.

Nike Skateboarding's Apology

June 27, 2005

To: Minor Threat, Dischord Records and fans of both

Re: Major Threat East Coast Tour Poster

Nike Skateboarding sincerely apologizes for the creation of a tour poster inspired by Minor Threat's album cover. Despite rumors being circulated, Weiden & Kennedy and Odopod had nothing to do with the creation of this tour poster and should not be held accountable. To set the record straight, Nike Skateboarding's "Major Threat" Tour poster was designed, executed and promoted by skateboarders, for skateboarders. All of the Nike employees responsible for the creation of the tour flyer are fans of both Minor Threat and Dischord records and have nothing but respect for both.

Minor Threat's music and iconographic album cover have been an inspiration to countless skateboarders since the record came out in 1981. And for the members of the Nike Skateboarding staff, this is no different. Because of the album's strong imagery and because our East Coast tour ends in Washington, DC, we felt it was a perfect fit. This was a poor judgement call and should not have been executed without consulting Minor Threat and Dischord Records.

We apologize for any problems this may have caused, and want to make very clear that we have no relationship with the members of Minor Threat, Dischord Records and they have not endorsed our products. We would also like to extend an apology to Susie Josephson Horgan, the photographer who took the original photo for the Minor Threat album.

Every effort has been made to remove and dispose of all flyers (both print and digital). Again, Nike Skateboarding sincerely apologizes to Minor Threat and Dischord Records.

Sincerely,

    Nike Skateboarding
