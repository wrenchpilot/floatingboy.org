posted some new pics in the photos section of the show last night. was a good show, i've got the
bruises to prove it. also, i didn't get arrested. right now my
head hurts, knees are bruised and my ears are ringing. did you
just say something? what?

**TUESDAY - AVAIL**

been looking from outside

i've been watching

but i don't know what to say

changed the old backdrop

same face

but not who it used to be

trying to get our not out getting

thinking, you're everything you said

you wouldn't be

time out, i see right through

you're running around again

i'm around

and still confused in an instant

can't quite relate

and i don't know what to say

all of the bonds i see

that i'm not part of

it's not how it used to be

you're running around again

i'm around

and i've been cracking on the inside

it gets worse each day

and i don't know what to say

keeping my distance

but still i see

it's not how it used to be

bushing the time in a daze

wondering how it got this way

time out, i've gotta ask it

am i on my own?

truth

numbed by feelings

truth

Drink Till We're Gone - Lucero\*\*

life is short

despite of your plans

so tell the girls they're pretty while you can

'cause one day they're gone

and all you got left

some empty bottles and an old country song

plays on and on

i wasted my time

with these cigarettes

and these ashes are all i got left

watch this old town

nothing's left for me

wash downstream

and into the sea

because this big old river

will kill us in time

'till then we'll drink it's weight

in cheap beer and wine

we can drink just as fast

as the river is strong

and we'll drink 'till we're gone
