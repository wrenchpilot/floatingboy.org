the first skateboard i ever owned, that was bought for me, brand new
was frankie hill's first pro deck from powell peralta, the
bulldog. i skated that board into oblivion. the nose, the
tail, skated to nubs. it finally broke not long after i did
my first handrail. i kept the board's 2 pieces for a long time
and eventually lost them. i also owned, if i can remember
correctly, frankie's last board from powell peralta, the v2 slipskin
(bullshit) Frank Tank. this board was also skated to peices, and
the crappy v2 slipskin shit peeled off. frankie hill left powell
at some point and skated for consolidated, then as far as i know, just
disappeared. i've always wondered what the hell happened to my
favorite skateboarder, the guy who inspired me to put my life on the
line for a set of stairs, or an insane gap. the guy who taught me
to really pull a fat ollie, just by looking at his pictures in
magazines, so tucked with his knees up by his ears, flying through the
air. after all this time, he's back. skating for [Revolver](http://www.revolverskateboards.com/). [paycheck frankie hill](http://www.skateboarding.com/skate/article/print/0,12775,1009368,00.html)
