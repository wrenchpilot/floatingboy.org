losing focus. constantly looking for something to take my mind off the last thing i was doing. a perpetual state of digression, taking on endless tangents until i'm so lost and uninterested i have no control over my impulses and don't care about what would seem to be important things.

my right upper arm goes into muscle spasms from time to time, only at work during the day it seems.

see case in point, that last bit had nothing to do with anything.

i hope i never go deaf. i would like to smoke a cigar. i wonder if anyone has sent me any email. i want a diet coke. i have to pee. using dbmscopy to import excel spreadsheets into oracle creates retarded column types. goddamnit, i have songs missing from albums in iTunes. when i call someone on my cell phone, i can't hear anything, maybe i should throw it against the fucking wall. that actually worked. i got something done today.
