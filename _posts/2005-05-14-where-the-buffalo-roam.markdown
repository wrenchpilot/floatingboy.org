this will encompass a couple of days...

so, i walked into Kenneth Cole friday, because i'm all about high fashion, and to what do my wondering ears do i hear. The Postal Service. and i have no point.

next topic.

so, i'm riding this shuttle from Denver to Keystone, and this guy named Mitch is hitting on every single woman in the goddamn van (there's 6 of them), i did every thing in my power to not laugh my ass off at this guy (mostly the reason i didn't is b/c i really had to piss, but i digress). this guy dropped more names than i've ever heard in my entire life. Let's make a list, shall we.

As stated in the never ending "storytelling" by this guy Mitch.

1. His daughter is marrying (name drop #1) Brad Pitt's...nephew.

2. He recently had lunch with...Tom Selleck.

3. Was in some meeting with Jimmy Carter and Teddy Rosevelt's grandson that had something to do with providing water to Las Vegas. (I swear to fucking christ i'm not making this shit up)

4. Now this last one i didn't catch exactly the 2 names he dropped, i had my earphones in trying to ignore this asshole, but it had something to do with fishing with someone named "gary" (in my mind i inserted Gary Coleman) and someone else that i can't remember the name of but was so "impressed?" with this guy, he sent him his "out of print" book signed, i wish i could remember who it was, but it really doesn't matter, b/c i've never heard so much bullshit in my life in
   such a short time span.

to back track a bit, the plane ride over was also a demon hell ride. the plane was the vessel for a senior class trip to a dude ranch, thank the fucking gods for headphones, i would have rather the plane be filled with screaming babies. i had this eerie feeling that the plane was going to crash on the fact that these kids didn't deserve to live.
