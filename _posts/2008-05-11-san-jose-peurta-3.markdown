Waiting to fly back to Atlanta, and I just dropped $12 on the worst sandwich ever. If you ever come to San Jose, don't eat at the airport.
I was too busy surfing and hanging out to take any pictures while in Costa Rica, although I did get a few shots of Sebastian the peeping-tom howler monkey. To be honest, they don't really "howl" as much as they grunt and show you their balls.
