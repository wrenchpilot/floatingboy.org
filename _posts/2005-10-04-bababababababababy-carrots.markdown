I got there too early. Unbeknownst to me, it was also open mic
night. The guy at the door asked me if I "played laptop". I think the blank stare answered the question.

The first act (Divided Like a Saint's if I remember correctly) played in the middle of the bar area, completely opposite the stage. They had a drummer with a single snare and kick drum set up between the pool tables, a violin player and an accoustic guitar. No mics, no amplification. I enjoyed. It was completely preservative free, organic, free range music. The rest of the open mic acts, aside from the guy on the guitar directly after Divided Like a Saint's, was just various forms of knob twisting and button pushing, testing the limits of hipster patience.

Grand Buffet's new DJ (DJ Jester the Filipino Fist) warmed up the set. He was probably the only DJ "I've" seen spin that was actually good. At least I was able to see and appreciate the timing and style. In the end, everybody profited and felt refreshed. The cat in the hat ate all the baby carrots.
