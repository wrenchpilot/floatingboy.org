i hung a hammock today. was easier than i thought and worked
exactly as planned. i won't be able to lie (lay?) in it until
tomorrow. on another note, i don't like massively complicated
relational databases, let me re-phrase, i don't like designing
massively complicated relational databases. too much pressure. i
need a nap.
