i've been racking my brain to figure this out, and it just hit
me. the song "by" green day "jesus of the suburbia" rips off the
chorus melody from bryan adam's "summer of '69". i can't be the
only person that's heard this. i'd post samples of each, but how
are you going to learn to do anything for yourself if i do that? you
lazy bastard.

also, i was watching garden state again the other day and i distinctly heard Ice-T's "I'm your pusher"
playing in the background. what i want to know is, why wasn't it
on the soundtrack? answer that mr. smartass, Zach Braff.
