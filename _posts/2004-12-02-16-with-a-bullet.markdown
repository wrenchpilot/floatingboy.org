i was tapping my toes, snapping my fingers and looking over my usage stats. every now and again someone comes to this site via a referrer. almost 90% of the time it's due to a search query from one of the various search engines. i see all kinds of weird and not so weird shit in the logs. most of them are my friends doing googles on themselves and ending up at my site. but every now and again a true "nugget" (as in shit, not chicken) floats to the top and catches my eye, and instead of flushing i thought i'd scoop it up and pass it around. so, anyway, i was looking through my usage stats and found that someone had found there way to my website via an MSN websearch. what's nice about the logs is i can see what they searched for to get to my lovely web site. at first i was excited because i thought that i was the first search result but alas i was number 16 (although I am the very first link on the second page of results). Hopefully I can climb the charts for the web's #1 website for.......here comes the search query....are you ready? after reading all the shit above, can you stand it any longer?....ok, here it is "[free drunken rape pics](http://tinyurl.com/3snfh)". in case the search results changed, here's a screen to show i'm not cheating for this coveted spot in the search results. what's really great is the xmas link just under mine...how'd i beat out a xmas site for free drunken rape pics??
