life is short  
despite of your plans  
so tell the girls they're pretty while you can  
'cause one day they're gone  
and all you got left  
some empty bottles and an old country song  
plays on and on

i wasted my time  
with these cigarettes  
and these ashes are all i got left  
watch this old town  
nothing's left for me  
wash downstream  
and into the sea

because this big old river  
will kill us in time  
'till then we'll drink it's weight  
in cheap beer and wine  
we can drink just as fast  
as the river is strong  
and we'll drink 'till we're gone
