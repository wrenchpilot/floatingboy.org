well, New Orleans has been conquered. No thanks to Jason for bailing
out. There is no excuse. I should totally be writing my research paper,
that is due tomorrw, right now. I fear that my instructor will be
disappointed in this one. Whatever shall I do?

Huge thanks to all that made this past weekend possible...Jacee,
Stevie, Adrianne, Brad, Noel, Eric...Pictures will be posted in due
time. Punch and pie was not served, but we did get bacon. Angel, who is
the most awesome girlfriend in the world, is my girlfriend. So nah! She
says hi to anyone bored enough to read this. And if you haven't yet, go
out and buy the new Death Cab For Cutie CD, or better yet, get drunk
and go see them play live. I think we can all agree that that would be
best.

ps

eventually, someone will have to fill me in on what we did after the show.

pps

you're welcome
