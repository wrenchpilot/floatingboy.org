Take all your problems

And rip em apart

Carry them off

In a shopping cart

And another thing you

Should've known from the start

The problems in hand

Are lighter than at heart

**Be like the squirrel, girl**

**Be like the squirrel**

Give it a whirl, girl

**Be like the squirrel**

And another thing

You have to know in this world

Cut up your hair

Straighten
your curls

Well, your problems

Hide In your curls
