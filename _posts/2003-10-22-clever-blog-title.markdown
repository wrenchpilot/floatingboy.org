watching tv, surfing the net (i always hated that term) at the same time and not paying attention to either. they seem to be canceling each other out. but, what seems to be getting through is that TV and the internet both suck. lame shows, lame websites (like this one). watching tv as i get older puts me in a constant state of deja vu. and to make matters worse (not really) my mysterious free HBO went away as mysteriously as it came...although, i don't think i miss it....man, this counter culture has got me all bug-a-boo.
