well, my life is drawing more close to completion. we saw the pixies (how cool is that?) in birmingham, al (not so cool).  
ATTENTION BIRMINGHAM, AL!! YOU HAVE SOME HOMEWORK!

you seriously need to work on:

1. Timing, i've been to more than one show in Birmingham that ended before 11pm and the entire venue shut down. what the fuck? (granted this was a tuesday, but still if it would have been in Jackson, MS we would have ended up at a pool party with the Pixies)
2. NO FUCKING SEATS! Having a show with "assisgned" seats is for fucking OLD PEOPLE!! (luckily not many old people were there and no one on the floor sat in there "assisnged" seats, in fact our tickets were for the nosebleeds, pfffftt)
3. PS. to #2, If you're going to have seats then people will stand in them, no getting around it. (word to wise, stand on the end of the seat, not towards the back were the seat folds, you will fall and/or break your shins, your welcome)
4. Shay, I'm breaking up with your boyfriend for you.
5. There was very real epidemic of people wearing Pixies t-shirts at the Pixies concert, for fucks sake, that's rule number one.
6. where was the beer? WHERE WAS THE BEER?! you do not sell POPCORN! OH MY GOD!!
   Seriously Birmingham, I will fail your ass if you don't get your shit together. but i will give you some extra credit for free parking and [The Garage Cafe](http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2806595-garage_cafe_the_birmingham-i), nice little place to buy beer, but not popcorn.

added some [pictures](/old/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=pixies) of the Pixies show in the Photos section, nothing to fancy.
