wishing for the days when i first wore this suit.

baby has grown older, it is no longer cute.

man, too many voices they made me mute

baby has grown ugly, it is no longer cute.

but i stay on, i stay on. where do i get off?

on the greener pastures, the core is getting soft.

look at us today, we've gotten soft and fat.

waiting for the moment, it's just not coming back

man, so serious about the stuff we lack.

what about our memories? but there are no facts.

on, i stay on. where do i get off?

do you remember the time,

i don't know, in fact, about, i don't know

about three years ago?

back when punk was new and exciting...

do you remeber the when?

yeah, so do i. we call those the salad days.

and do you remember when?

yeah, so do i. we call those the good o'days

and where the fuck am i? i call it a lie.
