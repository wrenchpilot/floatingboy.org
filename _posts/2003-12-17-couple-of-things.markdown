first off, back from Stowe, brought a cracked rib back with me and we didn't take any pictures, too cold. check the links section for some new links. [Underground Apparel by Judith Agrathea](http://www.cafepress.com/agrathea) and from yours truly [Floating Boy Merchandise](http://www.cafepress.com/floatingboy). how cool is that? more stuff will be added to the FBM as time passes....all proceeds go to a secret fund that i can't tell you about, but i will tell you as soon as there is enough to buy me a new car.

mood: cracked | music: Edith Piaf
