damnit, damnit, damn it, dam nit, da m nit! Atlanta is getting on my bad side....it goes like this

everytime a band i want to see comes to Atlanta one of two things, if not both, happen.

1. the show is grossly overpriced

2. the show sells out before i can get tickets

anyone want to see [the arcade fire](http://www.arcadefire.com/) tonight?? well, tough shit, it's [sold out](http://tinyurl.com/6mam9).

keep pushing, fuckers, just keep pushing...

mood: fresh cut hair | music: the arcade fire
