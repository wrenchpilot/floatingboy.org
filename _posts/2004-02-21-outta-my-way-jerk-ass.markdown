happy 5 year to me and Angel (yestarday)

Congratz to Jacee on her job, thanks to me, I'll be expecting 15% cut from all future paychecks.

found this kick ass Russian food store that sells Baltica no. 6 pints
for $1.99 per bottle, they're 7% alcohol by volume! how cool is that?

Was going to go on a hot air balloon ride today but was told it was too
windy, which to me would seem to make it a perfect day for a balloon
ride, damnit.

Last but not least, looks like the [Pixies](http://www.4ad.com/artists/catalogue/pixies/)
will be getting back together for a "we were a really good band, then
we broke up and people were bummed, so let's get back together and make
a shit ton of money" tour.

mood: fat | music: sharks keep moving
