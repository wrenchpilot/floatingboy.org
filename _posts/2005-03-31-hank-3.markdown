i went and saw hank williams III last night, and forgot my
camera. was a better show than i thought it would be, although i
didn't stay the whole time. it was hotter than the 7th
circle of liquid hell in there. at some point, i'd swear i saw
him snort cocaine in between songs. may have been just a gimmick
or part of the act, but i doubt it.

If i had taken pictures, it might have looked like this.
