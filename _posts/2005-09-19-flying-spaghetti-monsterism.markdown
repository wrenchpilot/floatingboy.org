\*\*Quoted from Wikipedia:

Flying Spaghetti Monsterism\*\* is a satirical parody religion created to protest the decision by the [Kansas State Board of Education](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_evolution_in_public_education#Recent_developments_in_state_education_programs) to allow [intelligent design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design) to be taught in science classes alongside [evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution).

The "religion" has become an Internet phenomenon that has garnered many "followers" of the **Flying Spaghetti Monster** (sometimes referring to themselves as "**Pastafarians**," a pun on Rastafarians)
who claim to have been touched by "His Noodly Appendage" and preach the
word of their "noodly master" as the one true religion. Flying
Spaghetti Monsterism is primarily the invention of Bobby Henderson, a
graduate of Oregon State University with a degree in physics.
