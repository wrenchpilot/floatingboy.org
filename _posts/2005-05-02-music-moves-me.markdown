after breaking 2 mp3 players, i finally decided to get the real
deal. the iPod. why i didn't do this in the first place?
who knows. why am i doing it now? who cares. the point is...well there
is no point, i have an iPod nah nah na na boo boo. well, it's in
china at the moment, shanghia to be exact. should be here
wednesday.

on an all together unrelated topic, i just
found out i'm going to keystone, co in a couple of weeks for a
conference or something, who cares, i'm going snowboarding on the
company dime.

last but not least, i get to fail my
calculus II final tomorrow and be done with it. who/whom ever is
responsible for calculus should have there balls crushed.
_shudder_ i just made myself cringe.
